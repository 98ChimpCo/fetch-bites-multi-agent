This soy garlic chicken is one of my families all time favorite recipes. It’s a simpler version  of my mom’s soy garlic fried chicken.  The chicken is pan-fried until super crispy and then glazed with this 5 ingredient sauce. Make sure to double the glaze amount below if you want some extra sauce to put on your rice.
