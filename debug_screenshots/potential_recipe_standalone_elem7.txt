For focaccia dough
740 grams all purpose flour
A pinch of salt
12 grams sugar
2 packets rapid rise instant yeast 
540 g warm water 

For blueberry compote 
3 cups blueberries
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp water
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract 
Cornstarch slurry (1 tbsp corn starch + 1 1/2 tbsp water mixed together)

For crumble 
2/3 cup flour
2/3 cup sugar 
1/4 cup melted butter 

For icing
1 cup powdered sugar
Zest of 1 lemon
Juice of 1/2 lemon or more if you want a thinner consistency 
3 tbsp melted butter for the pan
First make your blueberry compote by combining blueberries, lemon juice, water, vanilla, and sugar in a skillet and cook on medium for 5 minutes until the berries have released their juice and the mixture is bubbling. Mix your corn starch and water then pour them into the blueberry mixture and cook for another couple minutes until thickened. Remove it from the heat and allow it to cool.
For the dough, mix all the dough ingredients together in a stand mixer (or by hand in a a bowl), and kneed for about 5-10 minutes until dough comes together and is smooth. You don’t need to bloom the yeast if you are using instant yeast but if you are using another kind, bloom it first in the warm water until it becomes frothy (about 5 minutes) before mixing in the dry ingredients.
Melt the 3 tbsp of butter than pour it onto the bottom of a sheet pan (I used a half sheet pan but you could use a full size and stretch it out more) Comment was written by the post author. Comment is pinned.
