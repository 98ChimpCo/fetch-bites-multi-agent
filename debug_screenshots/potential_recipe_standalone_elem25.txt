Ingredients:
1kg lamb ribs
Oil or ghee 
1 bulb garlic crushed
2 inch large piece ginger grated
1.5 heaped tsp salt
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper 
2 tsp smoked paprika 
1.5 tsp chaat masala 
1 tsp chilli powder or to taste

1 tbsp kasuri methi
4 tbsp concentrated tamarind paste 
2 tbsp harrissa paste or tomato puree 
1 tbsp Greek yoghurt 
1/2 measuring cup fresh coriander chopped 

Method:
- Mix the ribs and marinade ingredients together well. Leave to marinate overnight for best results or at least 4 hours. 
- Before you start cooking the ribs, heat the oven on the highest setting for 30 minutes.
- Place the ribs in a oven safe dish. Cover well with multiple pieces of foil, making sure to seal and secure the edges so no steam can escape. 
- Place the dish into the oven and reduce the temperature to 170c. Cook for 2 to 2.5 hours. This will depend on the size of the ribs and the oven.
- After this, uncover, baste with the sauce from the dish, then cook in the oven again for 5 -10 mins, until the sauce sets on the ribs.
- You can use the sauce at the bottom of the dish as a dip for the ribs, drain away excess fat from the dish. 
- Top with fresh coriander.
