## Recent Bug Fixes

### Email Validation Bug
We identified and fixed a critical bug in the email validation logic:

1. **Issue**: The `is_valid_email()` method in the `UserStateManager` class was missing the `self` parameter, causing errors when called from instance methods.

2. **Solution**: Updated the method signature to include `self` as the first parameter:
   ```python
   def is_valid_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
       """Check if the given string is a valid email address."""
       # Method implementation...
   ```

3. **Impact**: This fix resolves the errors occurring during user interactions when email validation is performed, enabling the conversation flow to work properly.

### Message Input Field Detection
We've identified issues with message input field detection and implemented multiple approaches:

1. **Multiple Selector Strategies**: Added varied selectors for input field detection using CSS selectors, XPath, and JavaScript techniques.

2. **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Implemented specialized JavaScript for more flexible field detection and interaction.

3. **Viewport Coordinate Fallback**: Added alternative approach using screen coordinates when selectors fail.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete DM Conversation Testing**:
   - Test full conversation flow with various entry points
   - Verify proper state transitions in user interactions
   - Ensure reliable message sending and receiving

2. **Finalize Recipe Delivery**:
   - Connect PDF generation with email delivery
   - Implement delivery tracking and confirmation
   - Add error handling for delivery failures

3. **Begin Small-Scale User Testing**:
   - Set up monitored test accounts
   - Document user experiences and feedback
   - Identify areas for improvement

## Lessons Learned

1. **Instagram Automation Resilience**:
   - Instagram's interface changes frequently, requiring flexible automation approaches
   - Multiple fallback strategies are critical for reliability
   - Screenshot logging is invaluable for visual debugging

2. **State Management Importance**:
   - Proper state tracking is essential for asynchronous conversations
   - File-based persistence ensures continuity across sessions
   - Clear state transitions help maintain conversation flow

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Detailed logging is critical for identifying issues
   - Multiple fallback approaches improve reliability
   - Graceful degradation keeps the system functional

## Developer Notes

1. **Running the System**:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv fresh_venv
   source fresh_venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Run the application
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Debugging Tips**:
   - Check the `screenshots/` directory for visual debugging of Instagram interactions
   - Review logs for detailed error information
   - Test individual components using the test scripts

3. **Current Focus Areas**:
   - Resolving input field detection issues
   - Improving recipe extraction accuracy
   - Enhancing email validation reliability
