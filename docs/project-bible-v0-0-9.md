Instagram employs various techniques to detect and block automated browsers.

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Multiple Browser Fingerprinting Defenses**
   - WebDriver property masking
   - JavaScript execution for DOM manipulation
   - Cookie-based authentication for faster access

2. **Dynamic Element Finding**
   - Multiple selector strategies for each element
   - JavaScript-based element identification
   - Fallback approaches when primary methods fail

3. **Conversation Prioritization**
   - Focus on human conversations with relevant content
   - Multi-tier prioritization system
   - Filtering out system conversations

#### Challenge: Message Input Field Detection
Finding and interacting with message input fields is particularly challenging.

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Multi-method Input Detection**
   - Multiple selectors and approaches
   - JavaScript-based element focusing
   - Action chains for reliable interaction

2. **Contextual Processing**
   - Process messages in the context of their conversation
   - Direct response while in the active conversation
   - Fallback message sending strategies

### Recipe Extraction Challenges

#### Challenge: Varied Content Sharing Methods
Instagram content can be shared in multiple formats.

**Solutions Implemented:**

## Key Code Implementations

### Enhanced Instagram Message Monitoring

```python
def check_new_messages(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Check for new messages in the Instagram inbox."""
    try:
        # Navigate to inbox fresh
        self.driver.get("https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/")
        time.sleep(3)
        
        # Find conversations using JavaScript to avoid stale element issues
        conversations_js = """
        let results = [];
        try {
            // Get all conversation elements
            const allConvos = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('div[role="listitem"], div[role="button"]'));
            
            // Get only elements with text content
            results = allConvos
                .filter(el => {
                    const text = el.textContent && el.textContent.trim();
                    return text && text.length > 0 && 
                           !text.includes('Page Not Found') && 
                           !text.includes('Requests');
                })
                .map((el, index) => ({
                    index: index,
                    text: el.textContent.trim(),
                    hasUnread: el.textContent.includes('New message')
                }));
        } catch (e) {
            console.error('Error finding conversations:', e);
        }
        return results;
        """
        
        conversations = self.driver.execute_script(conversations_js)
        
        # Prioritize conversations with "Hello" or recipe content
        hello_conversations = [c for c in conversations if 'hello' in c.get('text', '').lower()]
        recipe_conversations = [c for c in conversations if any(term in c.get('text', '').lower() 
                                for term in ['recipe', 'food', 'cook', 'kauscooks'])]
        
        # Process conversations in priority order
        # [implementation details omitted for brevity]
        
        return new_messages
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error checking new messages: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

### Recipe Content Extraction

```python
def extract_post_content(self, post_url_or_content, max_retries=3):
    """Extract content from an Instagram post URL or shared content."""
    # Check if input is a valid URL or direct content
    is_url = post_url_or_content.startswith('http')
    
    # Handle direct content (not a URL)
    if not is_url:
        logger.info("Processing direct content share rather than URL...")
        
        # Create a content object from the shared post
        content = {
            'caption': post_url_or_content,
            'username': self._extract_username_from_content(post_url_or_content),
            'hashtags': self._extract_hashtags_from_content(post_url_or_content),
            'recipe_indicators': self._check_recipe_indicators(post_url_or_content),
            'urls': self._extract_urls_from_content(post_url_or_content),
            'source': {
                'platform': 'Instagram',
                'url': 'Direct share',
                'extraction_date': time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
            }
        }
        
        return content
        
    # Handle URL-based extraction
    # [implementation details omitted for brevity]
```
