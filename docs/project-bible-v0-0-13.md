# Project Bible: Instagram Recipe Multi-Agent System (v0.0.13)

## Overview
**Project Name:** Fetch Bites Multi-Agent System  
**Start Date:** March 10, 2025  
**Current Version:** v0.0.13  
**Last Updated:** March 27, 2025

## ‚úÖ Current Milestone: Post Expansion + Vision-Based Recipe Extraction

We‚Äôve achieved a breakthrough in expanding shared posts directly within Instagram DMs via DOM and Claude Vision fallback strategies. The agent can now visually click into a shared post, extract a screenshot, and prepare it for recipe analysis and PDF generation.

## üß† Technical Highlights

### 1. Shared Post Expansion

- DOM and Vision fallback methods implemented for post preview detection
- Click success is verified by UI state (presence of send input, close button)
- Fallback behavior gated to prevent infinite loops or mis-clicks
- Post-expansion screenshots saved for analysis

### 2. Claude Vision Screenshot Parsing

- Claude Vision successfully prompted to extract captions, hashtags, mentions from screenshots
- `analyze_image_and_get_json()` utility added to support vision-based JSON responses
- Claude Vision now integrated for:
  - UI element detection
  - Caption extraction
  - Coordinate click fallback

### 3. Post Screenshot ‚Üí Recipe ‚Üí PDF Flow (In Progress)

- `manual_post_tester.py` logic modularized into shared workflow
- Refactor started to move `process_post()` logic into `workflows/recipe_from_post.py`
- Claude extracts caption ‚ûù Recipe extractor parses ‚ûù PDF generator renders

## üß™ Testing Protocols

- ‚úÖ Claude fallback click opens post overlay successfully
- ‚úÖ Claude can parse screen into JSON structure
- ‚è≥ In-progress: PDF generation inline in DM flow
- ‚è≥ To-do: delivery based on user email intent
