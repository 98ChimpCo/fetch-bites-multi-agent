## ‚úÖ Current Milestone: Fully Functional MVP with Complete Recipe-to-PDF Flow

We've reached a major milestone with the Instagram Recipe Multi-Agent System, achieving a complete and reliable end-to-end workflow:

1. **Stable Instagram DM Monitoring** - Reliable detection of and navigation to unread conversation threads
2. **Enhanced Post Interaction** - Properly opening shared posts and expanding captions
3. **Robust Caption Extraction** - Successfully capturing full recipe content (2000+ characters)
4. **Recipe Processing & PDF Generation** - Transforming unstructured text into beautiful recipe PDFs
5. **Email Delivery** - Sending formatted PDFs to users
6. **Navigation Recovery** - Proper exit from post views regardless of recipe extraction outcome

The critical issue of getting stuck in expanded post views has been fixed, ensuring the system can reliably process posts even when network or API issues occur.

## üìù Technical Notes

### Post View Navigation Strategy

The key to reliable post processing has proven to be:

1. **Sequential Approach**: 
   - Open post ‚Üí Expand caption ‚Üí Extract text ‚Üí Exit post view ‚Üí Process recipe
   - This sequencing ensures we don't get stuck in post view during long API calls

2. **Multi-strategy Exit**:
   - Primary: Find and click back/close button
   - Fallback 1: Right swipe gesture
   - Fallback 2: Direct navigation as last resort

3. **Verification Steps**:
   - Verify UI state after navigation actions
   - Confirm caption extraction success before proceeding

### Remaining Enhancement Opportunities

While the core functionality is working well, there are opportunities for refinement:

1. **API Resilience**:
   - More robust handling of Anthropic API rate limiting/overloads
   - Local recipe extraction fallback for when API is unavailable

2. **User Experience**:
   - More natural onboarding conversation flow
   - Better progress indicators during recipe processing
   - More detailed extraction error messages
